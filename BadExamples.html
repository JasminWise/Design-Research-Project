            The website for the daily mail is a bad example of a navigation design because when you are trying to look through the website or find what you are looking for you get bombarded by ads and take your attention away from what you are looking for or looking at.

            Ebay is another example of a bad navigation design because you get a lot of ads and the layout is messy and you do not know what to look at or where to put your attention. 
            They also do not have a contestant color. They also do not try to help guide the user on how to user their website.
