            The Taco Bell website is a good example of navigation design because in the nav bar you can log in. 
            They also use a well known drop down nav bar within it and they use a different color for the things you can click instead of leaving it the background color.
             They also allow you to log in on the drop down nav bar and they have a search bar in the nav bar drop down.  
        </p>
      </div>

        <p class="yellow">
            Chick fil a is another good example of navigation design because they use a well known drop down nav bar. 
            Like most of the popular fast food websites it has the order button in the nav bar. 
            In the drop down nav bar they use a greater than sign facing down to show that this can drop down to more options. 
            They also put in a link called careers that way if the users that are looking to work there do not have to go out of their way and look which makes it more convenient to the users.

        <p class="yellow">
            The website for Sephora is another good example for navigation design. 
            Underneath their nav bar if you do not have an account or signed in they underline the words create an account and made it blue.
             When you click on the heart icon in the nav bar it turns black and then a message pops up telling you to sign up or login and what this icon is for.
              Underneath the sign in button they have buttons that are categorized in a way that users do not have to go out of their way to look for something.
